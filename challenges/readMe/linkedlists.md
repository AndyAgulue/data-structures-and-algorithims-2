# Zipped Linked-List

Combine two lists in an alternate manner.

## Description

Write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.

## Approach & Efficiency

Run a loop, while there are available positions in the first loop insert nodes of second list by changing pointers.
